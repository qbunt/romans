Transform ‚ö° numbers into Roman numerals (and back again) with this zero-dependency library. Perfect for when X, V, and I are more your style than 1, 2, 3. As [battle-tested](https://app.codecov.io/gh/qbunt/romans) as a gladiator ‚öîÔ∏è üèõÔ∏è

_Note: The license obligation check says there are dependencies, they are purely used for dev tests, the core library has no direct dependencies üí™_

## Security üîí

I take supply chain security **seriously** and run [socket.dev scans](https://socket.dev/npm/package/romans/overview/) on all PRs and releases. Although there are no dependencies on the library, I value your trust. If you see something, say something.

## FAQ ü§î

> What, why?

It started as a joke and became an interesting diversion, there are now more tests than library and it has a mind of it's own. Doing this was an interesting coding challenge problem that isn't the easiest to solve, and really, the Superbowl will have to use it eventually üôÉ. Also, love a silly thing.

> Why is there no `0`?

Roman numerals [didn't include 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Zero), so it's not included here. Yes, it's pedantry. No, I'm not adding it.

> I don't get it, why is this not an ESM module?

On the fence here, but mainly to support in older codebases that are CommonJS based. I value not having a compile step.

> Why didn't you build this in Typescript?

I value not having to set up typescript, and really, I do enjoy the simplicity of having a single library file. There are types and extensive JSDoc comments. Eventually, I'll cave and do multiple builds, but for now, this is fine. If you feel strongly about this decision, pull requests are open.

## Contributions ü§ù

If you'd like to contribute to this library, please [send a PR](https://github.com/qbunt/romans/pulls) or [file a new issue](https://github.com/qbunt/romans/issues). I aim to get PRs accepted in short order *should they align with the goals*. Also, be kind, again, this started as a joke. 

If you'd like to show appreciation, I love ‚òï.
